I'm a bioinformatician currently taking a break.
This blog doesn't offer search, analytics or anything with flair â€” I aim to keep the blog HTTP cookie and tracking free. The blog does use a content delivery framework for JS snippets and Google fonts.

This blog uses awesome comment system powered by [utterances](https://utteranc.es).
