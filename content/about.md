I'm a bioinformatician currently working at Karolinska Institutet.
This blog doesn't offer search, comments, analytics or anything with flair â€” I aim to keep the blog HTTP cookie and tracking free. The blog does use a content delivery framework for JS snippets and Google fonts(Arsenal).

Please create an issue on the [blog repository](https://github.com/siddharthst/blog) to comment or a [PR](https://github.com/siddharthst/blog/pulls) to suggest changes in any post. 

This beautiful theme was ported to Hugo by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui), and is based on [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy).
