# Preamble 
I like [Seaborn](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54788526/add-bar-plot-along-a-particular-axis-of-clustermap-with-index-specific-data). It is efficient, fast and does what it is meant to do - which is creating pretty figures. Since seaborn is build on top of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), the plots it generates can be (almost) emulated in Matplotlib. Some people might wonder, why reinvent the wheel? There are cases where seaborn might prove a bit difficult to work with, for example, [multipanel figures](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38082602/plotting-multiple-different-plots-in-one-figure-using-seaborn). Seaborn does provide Facet Grid to remedy shortcomings related to multi-panel figures, but this is good for arranging figures within seaborn mostly, not if you want to use Matplotlib or any other library based on Matplotlib with seaborn.

A recent [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54788526/add-bar-plot-along-a-particular-axis-of-clustermap-with-index-specific-data) of this was when I tried to create a stacked barplot along with the clustermap in Seaborn. I believe Seaborn uses [gridspec](https://matplotlib.org/api/gridspec_api.html) internally for plotting the clustermap but I was unable to modify it according to my specifications. To cut a long story short, I wasn't able to do it using Seaborn - and this does not mean that Seaborn is not good enough - it just says that I was not able to implement my design using the library. 

## GridSpec to rescue
I have been using seaborn for all of my Master's study, and it is still my go-to package for plotting exploratory figures. This also meant that I ignored GridSpec and other Matplotlib modules which might have been useful for me in the past. I mean, look at the [jointgrid](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.JointGrid.html) plots from Seaborn, they are so _awesome_. However, I couldn't use it for my clustermap and then I went to a path of self-discovery. What if..what if I used Matplotlib? The forgotten library which I only used to set Seaborn parameters.

Let's face it, Matplotlib sub-figures/panels/plots can be a bit messy. When it boils down to the basics, they are not that different from creating a basic single panel figure. My focus here will be on GridSpec instead of [subplots](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html). Let us think about gridspec for a while - the way figures are defined in gridspec resembles more to a 2-dimensional matrix. Following code creates a 3x3 gridspec matrix to work with:

{{< highlight python >}}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec
import matplotlib.style as style
style.use('bmh')

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(3, 3)
gs.update(wspace=0.05, hspace=0.05)
{{< /highlight >}}

Now let's "create" three subfigures - one for the scatter plot and two other which will show marginal distribution (that is, distribution along each axis). Our leading subfigure which will contain scatterplot will be of size 2x2(Width•Height) and the two subfigures which will store the information regarding distribution each will be of size 2x1(Width•Height). This has no relation to subfigure dimensions themselves, but how our subfigures are arranged in the gridspec object. Oh, and we will also create a legend axes for later use.

{{< highlight python >}}
ax_main = plt.subplot(gs[1:3, :2])
ax_xDist = plt.subplot(gs[0, :2],sharex=ax_main)
ax_yDist = plt.subplot(gs[1:3, 2],sharey=ax_main)

# We need to override style for legend axes

with plt.style.context(('classic')):
    ax_legend = plt.subplot(gs[0, 2:])
{{< /highlight >}}

Notice how the indexing works - it is similar to python 2D matrices, and you can [slice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17277100/python-slicing-a-multi-dimensional-array) it accordingly. Simply, you are now slicing the larger `gs` object into smaller subfigures.

## Awesome, but I want to plot already!
Oh, now comes the exciting part - maybe this is the reason why you would want to use GridSpec in the first place. Let's start plotting on subfigures sequentially. 

Load some data (in this case, you might need to install [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html)): 
{{< highlight python >}}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import random
from vega_datasets import data
source = data.iris()
source.head()
{{< /highlight >}}

The output should look like this:

||petalLength|petalWidth|sepalLength|sepalWidth|species|
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
|0     |1.4        |0.2       |5.1        |3.5       |setosa |
|1     |1.4        |0.2       |4.9        |3         |setosa |
|2     |1.3        |0.2       |4.7        |3.2       |setosa |
|3     |1.5        |0.2       |4.6        |3.1       |setosa |
|4     |1.4        |0.2       |5          |3.6       |setosa |

Now here comes the first different. We will be plotting the petal length and width for each species. To do so, we will first assign unique color to each species and then will create the scatterplot. To do this we will use the "main" subplot axes `ax_main`.

{{< highlight python >}}
# Set the color

species = list(set(source['species']))
NumberOfSpecies = len(species)
colorMap = plt.cm.Dark2.colors
colorDict = dict(zip(species, random.sample(colorMap, NumberOfSpecies)))

# Plot the scatterplot

ax_main.scatter(source['petalLength'], source['petalWidth'],
                c=source['species'].map(colorDict))
ax_main.set(xlabel='Petal length', ylabel='Petal width')
{{< /highlight >}}

Now the marginal distributions on axes `ax_xDist` and `ax_yDist`: 

{{< highlight python >}}
for i in species:
    tempDataFrame = source.loc[source['species'] == i]
    ax_xDist.hist(tempDataFrame['petalLength'], bins=10, align='mid',
                  color=colorDict[i], alpha=0.5)
    ax_yDist.hist(
        tempDataFrame['petalWidth'],
        bins=10,
        align='mid',
        color=colorDict[i],
        orientation='horizontal',
        alpha=0.5,
        )


# Do not forget to set axis labels !

ax_xDist.set(ylabel='count')
ax_yDist.set(xlabel='count')

# Make plot "pretty"
plt.setp(ax_xDist.get_xticklabels(), visible=False)
plt.setp(ax_yDist.get_yticklabels(), visible=False)

ax_main.tick_params(axis=u'both', which=u'both',length=0)
ax_xDist.tick_params(axis=u'both', which=u'both',length=0)
ax_yDist.tick_params(axis=u'both', which=u'both',length=0)

ax_legend.axis('off')
{{< /highlight >}}

Don't forget to add the legend! We can use the empty space at top right corner for the legend (remember the `ax_legend` axes we defined earlier ?).

{{< highlight python >}}
from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
legend_elements = []
for i in species:
    legend_elements.append(Line2D(
        [0],
        [0],
        marker='o',
        markersize=15,
        label=i,
        color='w',
        markerfacecolor=colorDict[i],
        ))
ax_legend.legend(handles=legend_elements, loc='center')
{{< /highlight >}}


Let's save the figure now: 

{{< highlight python >}}
fig.savefig('GridSpec.svg', bbox_inches="tight")
{{< /highlight >}}

The result: 

{{< figure src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/siddharthst/fbcd4779c0959e7aa180d9095d1d6483/raw/bd6ce7df261b248d113e62ddffe25fccf733deb3/post_2_result.svg?sanitize=true" alt="Seaborn jointplot" caption="Matplotlib GridSpec 101 - not bad, right ?">}}

Matplotlib is immensely powerful, if a bit underdocumented, but I still encourage experimentation! This is a simple example of GridSpec - one can use it to create complex multipanel figures. Certainly beats arranging things manually on Illustrator.
